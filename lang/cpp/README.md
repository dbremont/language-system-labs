# C++ Programming Langauge

> `C++` is a statically typed, multi-paradigm systems programming language that unifies low-level memory control with high-level abstraction mechanisms. It implements the imperative and procedural computational models natively, supports object-oriented programming with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and enables generic programming through templates and compile-time metaprogramming. Its execution model follows a close-to-hardware memory model with deterministic object lifetimes governed by RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and explicit control over stack and heap allocation, while also providing a modular compilation model via header inclusion and namespaces. C++ supports fine-grained concurrency with threads, atomic operations, and memory models conforming to the C++ memory model, alongside advanced features such as coroutines, constexpr evaluation, and template instantiation mechanisms. Its type system is nominal and static but allows type deduction (auto, decltype), overloading, and SFINAE-based specialization, making it suitable for high-performance, low-latency applications that require deterministic resource management, extensive compile-time computation, and close mapping to underlying hardware architectures.
